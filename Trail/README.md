# about
Extend the bouncing ball program to draw a trail. You can do this by drawing a smaller circle of a different color at the location of the ball every time the ball moves.

You should make the radius of the circles in the trail half the radius of the ball. The color of the trail should be cyan.

Also, you should stop the ball (stop the timer) after the ball bounces MAX_BOUNCES times.

Remember to use helper functions.

You can change the MAX_BOUNCES constant and the starting dx and dy to generate different drawings. Donâ€™t make MAX_BOUNCES too high, though, or it could slow down your program a lot.
