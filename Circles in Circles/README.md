# about
You should draw NUM_CIRCLES circles on top of each other. The bottom one should have a radius of BIG_RADIUS and each circle inside it should be sized in evenly spaced increments based on the number of circles being drawn.

They should all be sitting on the bottom of the screen, and each one should be a random color. Youâ€™ll need to use a for loop in this program and use i to figure out the size of each circle.
