# about
 
Write a program that draws a ball connected to a line. The line should start out in the center of the screen, and the ball should be centered on the line’s endpoint. (This is also at the center at the beginning of the program)

When the user moves the mouse, you should set the endpoint of the line and the ball’s location to the location of the mouse, as if the ball is on a leash.
