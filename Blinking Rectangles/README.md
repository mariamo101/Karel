# about
You should divide the canvas into an imaginary grid with NUM_RECTANGLES_ACROSS rectangles across, and NUM_RECTANGLES_DOWN rectangles down. Each time the user moves the mouse, a rectangle aligned with this grid should be drawn so that the mouseâ€™s location is within the rectangle. The rectangle should change color each time the mouse passes over it.

This requires using the mouseMoveMethod as well as writing a function.
