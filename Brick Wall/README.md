# about
Draw a brick wall that covers the canvas, brick by brick, starting from the bottom left corner. One brick should be drawn every 50ms. Your code should work for any brick height and length values, but when testing your code, make sure that your variables are set to the following:

LENGTH = 50
HEIGHT = 20
Your bricks should all have colors as assigned by Color.randomRed().

You should not use any for loops or while loops in your code. You should instead use a timer to draw bricks one by one.
